## Usage

To use the JavaScript projects, follow these steps:

1. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.

2. Explore the project files and locate the main JavaScript file. This file contains the logic and functionality of the project.

3. Customize the project according to your needs. You can modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to add new features or make changes.
